## Publisher: Quansight Labs

A person dynamically jumps down to the center of the cover. They're holding a sign titled "ALT". They have a bandana covering their eyes like a superhero domino mask, a la Robin. They are grinning widely and challenge the reader by saying "Join our sprints to make the world more accessible!"

The bottom of the cover contains several elements:
- Author and Artist: Mars Lee
- QR code to digital version of comics
- Price: $0.00
- Sticker: A snake circling around the words 'SciPy 2022 edition'

## Panel 1
Wide establishing shot of city skyline, in a cyberpunk future Two people are walking down a crowded alleyway. In the alleyway are faintly visible glowing signs with resturant logos and graphs.

The two people are 'Ally' and Friend'.

Friend and Ally are walking down an alleyway. Friend is using a white cane to navigate. The two of them are are chatting happily.

## Panel 2
Ally suddenly stops in front of the City Ramen sign
Ally: Hey, this is our stop! Yum yum!
Friend doesn’t stop with Alley. Keeps walking a little more.

## Panel 3
Friend looks back, slightly confused.
Friend: Oh, yeah, sorry. My screenreader didn’t detect anything. 

## Panel 4 
Ally angrily points at the City Ramen sign. The sign has a sticker labeled ‘Alt Text’ in the bottom left corner. 
Ally: Ugh, it didn’t? That means this sign is inaccessible!
Friend: Let me check with my screen reader.

## Panel 5
Friend tries to scan Alt Text label with scanner.
The scanner reads out “Alt Text: <empty>”
Friend: Hmmm, I'll check the menu too.

## Panel 6
Friend scans a different sign next to the “City Ramen” sign. The sign is the menu for City Ramen. The scanner reads <Alt Text: Menu for City Ramen.>

The full menu put on the sign reads
Menu for City Ramen
Broth base
Shoyu: $11
Gochujang: $12
Tonkotsu: $15
Toppings
Extra pork: $2.50
Boiled egg: $1.50
Extra sesame: $1
Extra scallions: $1

Most of these details are not in the sign's alt text and therefore not read out to Friend.

Well, this has some alt text. But it doesn't list what’s actually on the menu.

## Panel 7
Ally: I can read it out loud for you.

Friend looks down, body pointing away from Friend.
Friend: I know, and I appreciate it. I just... want to do it myself sometimes… I wish more images had alt text.
