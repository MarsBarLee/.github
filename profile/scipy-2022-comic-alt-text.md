A person, known as Ally, dynamically jumps down to the center of the cover. They're holding a sign titled "ALT". They have a bandana covering their eyes like a superhero domino mask, a la Robin. They are grinning widely and challenge the reader by saying "Join our sprints to make the world more accessible!"

The bottom of the cover contains several elements:

## Panel 1
Two people are walking down a dingy, cyberpunk alleyway. In the alleyway are faintly visible glowing signs with resturant logos and graphs. Discarded wrappers are stewn on the floor and pipes ominously puff out whisps of smoke. This city may not be the cleanest or most up-to-date, but its the most colorful and exciting city in the world.

The two people are 'Ally' and 'Friend'.

Friend and Ally are walking down the alleyway, not minding the grime of the city. They've known each other and the city for a long time. The two of them are are chatting happily.

Friend is using a white cane to navigate. It has a rollable marshmellow tip. It is non-collapsible- he prefers the extra sensitivity. He wears a cool pair of sunglasses.

Ally as a bandana across their head, like an 80s aerobics instructor or Rambo wannabe.

## Panel 2
Ally suddenly stops in front of the City Ramen sign
Ally: Hey, this is our stop! Yum yum!
Friend doesn’t stop with Alley. Keeps walking a little more.

## Panel 3
Friend looks back, slightly confused.
Friend: Oh, yeah, sorry. My screenreader didn’t detect anything. 

## Panel 4 
Ally angrily points at the City Ramen sign. The sign has a sticker labeled ‘Alt Text’ in the bottom left corner. 
Ally: Ugh, it didn’t? That means this sign is inaccessible!
Friend: Let me check with my screen reader.

## Panel 5
Friend tries to scan Alt Text label with scanner.
The scanner reads out “Alt Text: <empty>”
Friend: Hmmm, I'll check the menu too.

## Panel 6
Friend scans a different sign next to the “City Ramen” sign. The sign is the menu for City Ramen. The scanner reads '<Alt Text: Menu for City Ramen.>'

The full menu put on the sign reads
Menu for City Ramen
Broth base
Shoyu: $11
Gochujang: $12
Tonkotsu: $15
Toppings
Extra pork: $2.50
Boiled egg: $1.50
Extra sesame: $1
Extra scallions: $1

Most of these details are not in the sign's alt text and therefore not read out to Friend.

Friend: Well, this has some alt text. But it doesn't list what’s actually on the menu.

## Panel 7
Ally: I can read it out loud for you.

Friend looks down, body pointing away from Friend.
Friend: I know, and I appreciate it. I just... want to do it myself sometimes… I wish more images had alt text.

## Panels 1, 2, and 3
Ally is sad, shoulders slumped in defeat. Then Ally is suddenly angry, dark lines swirling their head like a storm. Then they have an idea, as the storm above their head subsides and turns into a lightbulb going off above their head.
  
## Panel 4:
Ally: Fine! If they won't add alt text to their own signs....

## Panel 5:
Ally dramatically pulls out a crayon from their pocket.
Ally: I'll do it myself!

## Panel 6:
Ally hastily scribbles alt text into the alt text property of the City Ramen sign.
Ally: I'll add alt text here!
  
## Panel 7, 8, 9
Ally runs down the alleyway, adding alt text to more and more signs.
Ally: And over here! 

Ally stretches up to a different sign.
Ally: And here!

Ally is now visibly tired, sweat pouring off their brown as their legs stumble.
Ally: ... And ... and here...

## Panel 10
Ally looks up to a giant billboard that takes up the majority of the panel. It is advertising a data analysis company known as 'Data Wizards' in a humorous way. In the center of the billboard is a big histogram.

Ally's mouth is hanging open. Their crayon, previously poised with confidence, hangs in mid-air.

Alley: Actually, what is this? It's got a bunch of math stuff... and a graph going up and down?

## Panel 1, 2
Intertwined panels of Friend and Ally talking to each other. Friend is walking down the alleyway towards where Ally ran off. Friend is smiling, slighly amused at Ally's perplexity. Ally is staring and shrugging at the histogram in the billboard.

Friend: What does the graph look like? Does it have an X and Y axis?

Ally: It's like a bar chart but all squished together. And the X axis and Y axis is about cows.

## Panel 2, 3, 4
Continued intertwined panels of Friend and Ally talking to each other.

Friend: Oh, sounds like a histogram! What are the units on the X and Y axis?

Ally is a little less afraid of math now. They point at the histogram and stroke their chin.
Ally: It's... a cow weight on the X axis... and frequency on the y axis...

Now Ally is on a roll, feeling much more confident about writing alt text about a histogram.

## Panel 5, 6
Ally jumps up, slamming their hands on the billboard, having just finished writing alt text.  A action bubble captioned 'DONE!' surronds them. Friend is walking by, having finally caught up with Ally.

Friend when turns around and scans the alt text property of the billboard using his screen-reader. The screen-reader beeps loudly. Ally looks on expectantly.

## Panel 7
The billboard takes up the majority of the panel again, but this time the billboard is covered by a giant speech bubble. The speech bubble is the alt-text Friend's screen-reader is reading out loud.

The screen-reader reads out:
"A billboard advertising the data analytics company, Data Wizards. A crystal ball projects a histogram about cows. The cow’s weight is in kilograms on the X axis. The frequency is on the Y axis. The distribution of symmetrical. The caption reads ”Predict trends with your company’s data! Make your mooooove with confidence!”"

Friend has a wide smile on his face. Ally is looking both up and at Friend. They are finally processing the absurdity of the billboard's humor and how important alt text is to Friend.

## Panel 8, 9, 10, 11
Three panels are arranged in a sunrise pattern. Friend is laughing in each of these three panels, as if he were the sun itself. In the middle and therefore lowest center of the sunrise, is the last panel, where Friend is looking up in earnest, eagerly absorbing Friend's reaction.

### Panel 8
Friend's hands are covering the bottom of his face, barely holding back his laughter.
Friend: Haha, all those extra little details about the graph...

### Panel 9
Friend then lets go, releasing his hands, letting them fly as as he erupts into laughter. Swirling visual elements of the histogram, such as the graph lines and bars, dance around him like sunbeams and sparkles.
Friend: I understand all of it! Every part!

### Panel 10
Friend now has calmed down a little, now gently grapsing his cane back to his body.
Friend: And I get the context. An ad about cows and data, huh? Thank you for doing this for me.

## Panel 1
Ally erupts into righteous fury, suddenly and comically gaining rippling biceps for exactly this one moment. Fire dance around them, reflecting the intesity in their eyes.
Ally: I'll add alt text for everything in this city!

## Panel 2
Friend shrugs and gestures to the looming alleyway filled to the brim with signs.
Friend: But this whole alleyway is filled with signs without alt text. It would take you a long time to do it all by yourself.

## Panels 3, 4, 5
These panels are very similar to earlier in the comic, when Ally first thought about writing alt text by themselves.

Ally is sad, shoulders slumped in defeat. Then Ally is suddenly angry, dark lines swirling their head like a storm. Then they have an idea, as the storm above their head subsides and turns into a lightbulb going off above their head.

## Panel 6
Ally hautily plays off Friend's reality check. They place a hand on their forehead, as if they already anctipated this and only feiged ignorance. A sparkle flies off their face, as they desperately imitate a charming anime character.

Ally: Of course.

## Panel 7
Ally dramatically pulls of their bandana off their forehead.
Ally: I don't have to do everything myself!

## Panel 8
Ally now ties the bandana across their eyes, like a domino mask worn by heros hiding their idetity such as Zorro or Batman.

Ally: I'll recruit others.

# Panel 9, 10, 11, 12
Three panels are arranged in a sunrise pattern, similar to the previous page. Ally is present in each of these three panels. In the middle and therefore lowest center of the sunrise, is the last panel, where Ally is waving their arms around as stars shoot out of them and the caption reads "Alt Text Task Force".

### Panel 9
Ally points to a chalkboard with the words "Alt" on it. Two imaginary people in scholar's cap look on at Ally, absorbing the knowledge being shared.
Ally: I'll teach people how to write alt text.

### Panel 10
The two newly minted scholars now eagerly write alt text for their own signs.
Ally: Then we'll add alt text, alley by alley, for the whole city.

### Panel 11
The two scholars now high-5 each other, having completed their alt text. Ally cheers from a distance.
Ally: Together, we are the "Alt Text Task Force"!

## Panel 12
Ally puts their hand to their forehread, searching far and wide. Their other hands graps the comic panel, slightly breaking the forth wall.
Ally: And the first person I'll recruit is...

## Panel 13
Ally snaps their hand around, now pointing directly at you, dear reader.
Ally: You!

## Panel 14
Ally leans so far forward their head breaks the comic panel again, now fully breaking the forth wall.
Ally: Join us in writing alt text! Let's make this city more accessible!
