hi there! the `alt-text-task-force` is reaching out to see if your project wanted to participate in an open source scavenger hunt hosted during SciPy 2022.
the goals of this event are to:

* introduce people to your community
* provide remote & in-person, low-code, beginner friendly ways for folks to participate in open-source [^history]
* bring multiple contributors into your project's revision history
* raise awareness and action for accessible documentation practices

## how to participate

to participate, we need:

* a project advocate to open a pull request by July 4. _this is the most time sensitive portion so we can print links to your contributions._
  * we generally recommend opening the pull request on a fork to cut down on notifications
  * there is a reference implementation open for [Project Jupyter](#reference), or refer to [past events][past]
* project advocates to add placeholders where alt text is needed in documentation by July 12
* project advocates to communicate _sometimes_ in-person and/or remotely from July 13-14
  * spread word about the project and your pull requests
* project advocates to review and close the pull request after July 15
* placeholders provided for participants to discover where alt text needs improvement
  * an example of placeholders for markdown documentation can be found in Jupyter's reference pull request.

## why participate

* your project and pull request will be featured in the digital and print scavenger hunt manifest
* your project and pull request will be featured in the digital and print in accessibility comic book distributed during SciPy
* it provides a proven way to on-board diverse contributors onto projects
* your documentation will be more accessible 

### reference

there is [a draft pull request started for Project Jupyter][reference], more placeholders will be added. 
y'all can use this copy to start your pull request.


[^history]: this started as a remote in the Project Jupyter community. since, its been run in NumPy, Dask, Napari, Scikit-Learn. you can learn more about [these low-code events on the Quansight Labs blog][https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2021/09/low-code-contributions-through-github/] or explore [past events][past].
