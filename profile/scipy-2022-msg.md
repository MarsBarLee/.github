hi there the `alt-text-task-force` is reaching out to see if you wanted to participate in an open source scavenger hunt hosted during SciPy 2022.
the goals of this event are to:

* provide remote & in-person, low-code, beginner friendly ways for folks to participate in open-source [^history]
* bring multiple contributors into your project's revision history
* raise awareness accessible documentation practices

## how to participate

to participate, we need:

* a project advocate to open a pull request by July 4
  * the body of the pull request contains information about how to modify your documentation with Github suggestions
  * see the reference implementation for copy or explore past pull requests to find what fits best for your project.
* project advocates to add placeholders where alt text is needed in documentation by July 12
* project advocates to communicate _sometimes_ in-person and/or remotely from July 13-14
  * spread word about the project and your pull requests
* project advocates to review and close the pull request after July 15
* placeholders provider for participants to discover where remediations need to be made
  * an example of placeholders for markdown documentation can be found in Jupyter's reference pull request.

## why participate

* your project and pull request will be featured in a comic book distributed during SciPy
* it provides a proven way to on-board people onto projects
* your documentation will be more accessible
