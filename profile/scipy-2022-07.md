# SciPy 2022 Conference Edition

The Alt Text Task Force has a mission for y'all at SciPy.
Our mission is to (1) have fun and (2) increase access to scientific Python.
We've designed a scavenger hunt for in-person/remote attendees to stop by your favorite
projects and submit better descriptions.

By participating:
* You'll be contributing to project revision histories.
* You'll interact with new folks.
* You'll learn to advocate for broader access to our scientific tools.

[^history]: The Alt Text workshop format started from Project Jupyter. The goal was a low-code, no-git workshop that worked for a lot of people. You can learn more about the history in our past blog posts, or even learn to run an event yourself
