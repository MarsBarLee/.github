# SciPy 2022 Conference Edition

The Alt Text Task Force has a mission for y'all at SciPy.
Our mission is to (1) have fun and (2) increase access to scientific Python.
We've designed a scavenger hunt for in-person/remote attendees to stop by your favorite
projects and submit better descriptions.

By participating:
* You'll be contributing to project revision histories.
* You'll interact with new folks.
* You'll learn to advocate for broader access to our scientific tools.
