Let's make the world more accessible! Let's add alt-text to scientific images and documentation! 

## In these workshops, we
- Crowd-source adding alt-text to images  
- By hosting 1-hour sprints where people make contributions  
- Using the Github Suggestion feature

### Who should sign up?
- Everyone!

- Accessibility advocates who want to tackle the unique challenges of accessible open source

### You will learn:
- What alt-text is
- How to write alt-text
- The unique challenges of writing alt-text for scientific images and documentation 
- How to overcome these challenges

### Who benefits?
- Disabled people who learn and contribute to science and math everyday
- You! After a workshop, you can carry this knowledge with you and spread accessibility to other communities
